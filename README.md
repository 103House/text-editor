Maybe someone can use this.

I am not a programmer. I do not know how to build things yourself. What I am, is an open-source person — so please no suggestions for Windows or Mac programs that might come close. And also no websites where you only discover after a lot of effort that you still have to buy credits to get your own work in shape.

I write. That is my way of living, thinking, feeling, breathing.
I work on several texts at the same time — that is the natural course of events for me. At the moment I do that in Gedit: simple, minimalistic, on Linux. Dark color scheme, helps me not to get overstimulated.

My texts are mainly in Dutch, in a mixture of Flemish and Dutch. So mistakes creep in, often unnoticed. And each text has its own style: a diary is something different from a soft letter, and something different again from a legal-philosophical text for worldbuilding. Each form requires a different language register.

What I am looking for seems simple — it already exists in my head. But in practice I can’t find it anywhere.

I am looking for the Swiss Army knife for writers.

A minimalist, open-source text editor with:

primary support for LaTeX (which the programmer also makes possible with other computer languages ​​is a nice bonus),

integrated spelling and grammar checker for Dutch,

an AI assistant that not only monitors my personal style, but also makes suggestions for sentence constructions, alternative formulations or even provides ideas while writing,

the ability to recognize different text types and styles and think along with them,

and: everything in one program. No fragmentation, no fifty windows, no time-consuming hassle. My memory is often faster than my fingers.

What I am not looking for:

no Word or something similar,

no patchwork of tools that you have to constantly switch between,

no system that only works after endless installation, plugging in, fine-tuning.

I just write. That's all.
